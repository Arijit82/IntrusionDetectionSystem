A HYBRID APPROACH TO ANOMALY DETECTION USING FUZZY LOGIC TUNED WITH EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
System description:
------------------




Steps in the project:
---------------------
1. Preprocessing : normalisation, quantifying data , feature selection 
2. Fuzzy model : Use Evolutionary algorithm (planned to use ant colony algorithm) to get fuzzy rule set .
3. Evolve : Model to evolve Fuzzy rule set with time :P 
4. and lot more :P .. Actually not at decided ..
